00:00:00 This artifact was commissioned by ross, jono, jacob and alex for their mothers to talk about their parents and how they impacted their lives.
00:02:53 I think my first memory ever is of one of these milestone things happening and mom being the one to make that happen.
00:04:34 Just as far as the music, she was always singing, she would do the dishes and she'd be singing flammy to the moon and viokandios and red roses for a blue lady.
00:05:37 They were always cool with any kind of music and singing and playing records that we wanted to do.
00:06:42 It was the exact opposite because our dad would play his stereo in the living room every night.
00:07:17 All of our abodes were small.
00:08:27 Our friend completely flipped out because that name that my mother said was actually the girl's real name.
00:10:43 I'll just never forget slapping her.
00:11:27 I think the overriding thing with my mother was to be kind to other people.
00:13:01 They were all very progressive and like minded people and very political and people to this day.
00:14:43 And still to this day, we both have good friends in our lives.
00:16:23 Her father had a severe bout of depression himself.
00:19:55 We're really able to give a lot to both of our kids.
00:21:05 This week's show comes from a 2004 party where jon stewart was sick with a broken leg.
00:21:37 Well, i would say to them, boys, you were mum's greatest dream come true.
